Firstly python should be installed In your pc.

After that you will have to open command prompt/Terminal in the project folder. 

Then run this command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (if using mac do pip3 instead of pip)

then run the project using ('python app.py') in terminal.

This will run the project in local computer and it will give the link which you can open in browser.
